# Super Awesome Battleship - THE GAME

## Description  

 A retro looking, simple battleship game.
The rules:

- O repsents the ocean on the board
- X means that the player has missed
- The player can only have 10 turns. If the player has run out of turns the a message will show saying "Game Over"
- If the player has guessed the same row and column, a message will appear "You guessed that one already" and they will lose a turn
- The player can only user numbers from 0 - 8 to guess rows and columns

### Bugs & Fixes

- Guess_row infinity loop
  - Even if the player inputs numbers, it will keep asking for an input. The player will have to press "enter" twice in order for the loop to stop and continue.
    - I have not been able to find a fix for this bug

### Planning & Design
For the game I wanted to go full on old school. Just a simple grid with Xs and Os.
